# Predicting-Price-of-used-Cars

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. The model leverages various features such as car make, model, year, mileage, condition, and location to provide accurate price estimates. This repository includes all the necessary steps from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.

Features
  1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
  3. Model Training: Training various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
  4. Model Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
  5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
  6. Deployment: Creating a simple API using Flask to serve the model and make predictions based on user inputs.
